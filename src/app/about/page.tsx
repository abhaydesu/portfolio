        Hi, I like keeping things simple â€” spending time with books, watching or playing football, talking about cars, and taking photos when something catches my eye.
        <br />

        I&#39;m someone who enjoys learning at my own pace and staying curious about different things, whether big or small. For me, it&#39;s less about big achievements and more about doing the things I enjoy and growing along the way.
