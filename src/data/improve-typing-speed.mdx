# How I Type 120+ WPM

The average typing speed among common people ranges from **35–40 WPM (words per minute)**. For regular computer users, it increases a bit to about **50 WPM**.  

The highest typing speed I've written at is **164 WPM in a 15-second test**. But I also used to type at 30–40 WPM. So what seems far-fetched for now, is just a bit of practice away!

## How I Started

One random day, my brother introduced me to [10FastFingers](https://10fastfingers.com), and that’s where everything began. This was during covid-lockdown times, and I found something to do during online classes.  

Initially, I just kept typing every day and reached around 70 WPM. But after that, my progress wasn’t the same. That’s when I thought I should focus more on **technique** and scoured the internet for resources (just like this!) to help me improve.  

I then came across websites like [TypingClub](https://www.typingclub.com), where I could practice touch-typing. [Keybr](https://www.keybr.com) is also a great website, which generates random words based on your weak keys. Then one day, while watching a BTS video from MKBHD, I came across [MonkeyType](https://monkeytype.com), and I’ve been practicing on it ever since.

## But Why Improve Typing Speed in the First Place?

People online throw around fancy words like *productivity* and *increased efficiency*. While it does help, I wouldn’t say it has a **massive impact** on your productivity, especially if you’re coding. Well… you can prompt faster, so there’s that!  

The real difference you feel is when you switch from **30–40 WPM to a speed where you’re comfortable with the keyboard** and don’t have to look at it while typing.  

Also, typing this fast *always* gets a reaction out of people around you — it’s fun to see the flabbergasted faces. You can even participate in typing competitions and win some quick bucks!  

And no, it’s not necessary to have a fancy mechanical keyboard. I typed on a **Windows laptop keyboard** and went from 30 to 160 WPM. I do have a mechanical keyboard now (*Aula F75*), but it’s definitely not a necessity.

## Steps to Improve Typing Speed

### 1. Familiarize Yourself
Muscle memory is key here. If you’re someone who doesn’t use your computer as often (basically if you have to look at your keyboard to find the keys), then this step is for you.  

It’s good if you have a solid foundation and start practicing touch-typing right away, but it can be a bit tough to follow through. What you need to remind yourself is that you’re in no hurry — just keep practicing and keep taking typing tests. Eventually, you’ll intuitively build muscle memory.  

However, make sure your **resting position** is proper. Always try to bring your fingers back to:
- Left hand: `a`, `s`, `d`, `f`
- Right hand: `j`, `k`, `l`, `;`  

Find the little bumps on the `f` and `j` keys and build a habit of locating them.

### 2. Focus
Your focus while writing tests should **always be on accuracy**. Speed will come eventually, but if you only chase speed and get into the habit of skipping wrong keystrokes, it might boost your test stats but will cause problems in real work.  

I know it’s tempting to push for a new PB (personal best), but believe me, accuracy is better for the long run.

### 3. Technique
Once you know where the keys are and have a solid resting position, work on practicing **touch-typing**. This is the most difficult part and takes consistent practice, but once you’re good at it, your progress will skyrocket.

---

### 4. Posture
Might sound unrelated, but having proper **sitting posture** while typing *does* help. And if you’re someone who spends long hours at a computer, we all need posture-fixing from time to time anyway. So this is killing two birds with one stone.

---

### 5. Configuration
Doing **30-second tests** is a good foundation. I used to do 60-second tests on 10FastFingers, but I don’t think they’re necessary. Once you’re confident, you can also try **15-second tests** to train for bursts of speed.

## Pro Tip 


![MonkeyType website screenshot](/monkeytype-setting.png)


Another great feature on MonkeyType:  
Go to **Settings > Behaviour > Languages** and select **English - 1k** or **English - 5k**.  

Yes, your typing speed in tests might drop a little, but if you get used to it, it’ll help tremendously in real-world typing.

## Final Thoughts

Like all other things in life, this is no rocket science. Just keep practicing and you’ll get there! The main thing is to avoid building wrong habits just to chase PBs in the short term.  

And honestly? It’s just a **cool skill to have**.
